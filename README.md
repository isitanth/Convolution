# Convolution Explorer

An interactive educational application for understanding convolution in signal processing through visual and mathematical analysis.

## Overview

Convolution Explorer is a comprehensive C-based application that demonstrates how convolution works in both time and frequency domains. It provides interactive visualizations, multiple demo modes, and hands-on learning experiences to help understand this fundamental operation in signal processing.

## What is Convolution?

Convolution is a mathematical operation that combines two signals to produce a third signal. It's defined as:

```
(x * h)[n] = Σ x[k] × h[n-k]
             k
```

Where:
- `x[n]` is the input signal
- `h[n]` is the kernel/filter
- `*` denotes convolution (not multiplication)
- The output combines information from both signals

### Applications

Convolution is fundamental to:
- **Digital Signal Processing**: Filtering, noise reduction
- **Image Processing**: Blur, sharpen, edge detection
- **System Analysis**: Characterizing linear time-invariant systems
- **Audio Processing**: Reverb, echo effects
- **Neural Networks**: Convolutional layers for feature extraction

## Mathematical Background

### Discrete Convolution

For two discrete signals x[n] and h[n], convolution is:
```
y[n] = (x * h)[n] = Σ x[k] × h[n-k]
```

This can be understood as:
1. **Flip** the kernel h[n] → h[-n]
2. **Shift** by n samples → h[n-k]
3. **Multiply** element-wise with x[k]
4. **Sum** all products

### Linear vs Circular Convolution

**Linear Convolution:**
- Output length: N + M - 1
- Assumes zero-padding outside signal bounds
- Used for filtering and system analysis

**Circular Convolution:**
- Output length: max(N, M)
- Wraps around signal boundaries
- Equivalent to FFT-based multiplication

### Frequency Domain Relationship

The Convolution Theorem states:
```
F{x * h} = F{x} × F{h}
```

Where F{} denotes the Fourier transform. This means:
- Convolution in time ↔ Multiplication in frequency
- FFT convolution exploits this for efficiency
